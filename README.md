# TimeFormatConverter
A program to convert from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation
This is a simple C++ program to convert a given time from 24-hour notation to 12-hour notation. 
It prompts the user to enter the hours and minutes, validates the input, and then displays the converted time.

# Usage

1. **Compile** the program using a C++ compiler.
2. **Run** the compiled executable.
3. Enter the time in 24-hour notation (e.g., "14 25").
4. The program will display the equivalent time in 12-hour notation.

# Example

Please enter the 24-hour notation time. Hours and minutes separated by space: 14 25
The 12-hour notation time is:
2:25 PM

# Requirements

- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ library

# Notes

- The program uses `assert` statements to validate input. Ensure that the entered time is within valid bounds (hours: 1-24, minutes: 0-59).
